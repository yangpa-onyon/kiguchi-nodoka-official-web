# Kiguchi Nodoka?

Hello. I'm Yangpa Onyon. As a former programmer and currently an unemployed vocaloid producer, I'm making an inanimate UTAU voicebank. (UTAU voicebank that only uses non-human sounds as their voice!)

Kiguchi Nodoka (機口喉歌) is an UTAU voicebank inspired by Rei Adachi, and it creates voice through acoustic simulation that mimics the structure of the human vocal tract.

By simulating the breath noise and the natural movement of resonances within the vocal tract, it can sing with a convincing tone despite being an inanimate UTAU.

# In development

Kiguchi Nodoka's in development right now. We’ll start the beta once things are further along.

But you can check out a preview already!
